# Hello! My name is Ricardo! (Or Ricky)
## ðŸ‘‡ Who I Am ðŸ‘‡
My name is Ricardo Benitez, but I go by Ricky. I am a "noob" in the data science world. I am currently enrolled in the data science program at Codeup. I have no doubt, with the help of my instuctors, that I will be a proficient data scientist once I graduate from Codeup.
